## Writeup

The challenge allowed users (players) to create characters, print their name, delete them and change their name. You could create either a barbarian or a wizzard (I only used barbarians).

There was an off-by-one write when creating new characters which could be exploited using the "shrink_free_hole_alloc_overlap_consolidate_backward" technique found at  https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.se/2014/08/the-poisoned-nul-byte-2014-edition.html.

It works by first allocating three blocks. Then free() the middle one. Then making it smaller by overwriting the size field of the free() one (Allocated_block1 overwrites 1 byte into Freed_block2).

After doing this we have a heap looking like:
```
|--------------------------------------------|
|       Allocated_block1                     |
|--------------------------------------------|
|                                            |
|                                            |
|                                            |
|                                            |
|                                            |
|        Freed_block2                        | <- heap manager thinks this block is smaller 
|                                            | than it is because we overflowed 1 byte from 
|                                            | Allocated_block1
|                                            |
|                                            |
|                                            |
|                                            |
|                                            |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Ghost space not seen by heap manager       |
|--------------------------------------------|
|       Allocated_block3                     |
|--------------------------------------------|
```
We then allocate 2 blocks inside Freed_block2, heap will look like:
```
|--------------------------------------------|
|       Allocated_block1                     |
|--------------------------------------------|
|       Allocated_block4                     |
|--------------------------------------------|
|       Allocated_block5                     |
|--------------------------------------------|
|                                            | 
|                                            |
|                                            |
|                                            |
|       Freed_block2                         | <- heap manager thinks this block is smaller 
|                                            |   than it is because we overflowed 1 byte from 
|                                            |   Allocated_block1
|                                            |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Ghost space not seen by heap manager       |
|--------------------------------------------|
|       Allocated_block3                     |
|--------------------------------------------|
```
When we then free() Allocated_block4 and Allocated_block3, the entire block will be free()'d because the original previous size (stored in "Ghost space") will still be there. Result:
```
|--------------------------------------------|
|       Allocated_block1                     |
|--------------------------------------------|
|                                            |
|- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - |
|       Allocated_block5                     |<- We still have a pointer to Allocated_block5, but the heap  
|- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - |  manager will think it's in free space 
|                                            | = use-after-free scenario.
|                                            |
|                                            |
|                                            |
|       Freed_block2                         |
|                                            |
|                                            |
|                                            |
|                                            |
|                                            |
|                                            |
|                                            |
|--------------------------------------------|
```

We can create a "write_what_where" by placing the name of a new barbarian over Allocated_block5. This means we can control the name pointer of the barbarian allocated inside Allocated_block5.

By changing the name of the new barbarian (and therefore changing the name pointer of Allocated_block5 barbarian) we can leak data anywhere. By changing it and using "change [whatever_string_is_at_that_address] [what_we_wanna_change_it_to]" we can write data anywhere.

Using the same technique (shrink free chunk) we can leak addresses from the heap. If we leak the VTable pointer of a barbarian, we can calculate the offset to got and then leak libc addresses.

Since I didn't know which libc version it was running, I wrote a leak loop searching for system() and the rop gadget I used (add_rsp90_pop3ret). I guessed the starting offsets by using the offsets of my local libc. They were ~300 bytes off.

We could then change the "print" function of one of the barbarians to point to the add_rsp_90_pop3ret gadget (rsp+0x90 will point to our input). That gadget would return into pop_rdi_ret (to get "/bin/sh" in rdi), which in turn returns to system().
